# FTC Driver Training Simulation

## Overview
A **browser-based FTC driver training simulation** that replicates a real field layout. Designed to help users practice robot movement, cycles, and strategy in a safe, interactive environment.

## Purpose
This project provides an **accessible training tool for FTC robotics drivers**, allowing practice without a physical robot or field. Demonstrates proficiency in **3D web development, interactive simulations, and game logic**.

## Features
- Realistic FTC field layout modeled in 3D  
- Interactive robot controls for forward/backward/turning movement  
- Cycle and strategy practice: simulate real game scenarios  
- Collision detection to mimic real-world constraints  
- Fully browser-based: runs on any modern browser  

## Tech Stack
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
- **Three.js** for 3D graphics and scene rendering  
- **HTML5 / CSS3** for layout and UI  

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codekidwizard/FTC-simulation
   ⚠️ Note: The simulation requires a **gamepad/controller** to play.
